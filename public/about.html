<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Subhalakshana M., a UI/UX designer with a diploma from the Bangalore School of Design. My education has given me a strong foundation in user-centered design principles, and Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several real-world projects that have honed my design skills. I specialize in creating intuitive, visually appealing digital experiences that prioritize the needs of users while aligning with business goals. My expertise lies in using design tools like Figma and Adobe XD to deliver functional, aesthetically pleasing prototypes.</p>

<p>Over the course of my career, I have worked on projects across different industries, including e-learning, fitness, and event management. For instance, I designed an e-learning application that addressed the challenges students face with remote learning, focusing on engagement, organization, and support. Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of creating user-friendly interfaces and enhanced my ability to integrate feedback and research into my design process.</p>

<p>Beyond my design experience, I have completed HR internships at LernX and Cycatz, where I cultivated strong communication, decision-making, and time-management skills. These experiences have contributed to my ability to collaborate effectively within teams and manage projects efficiently. I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to design challenges and am continuously looking to grow and evolve as a UI/UX professional.</p>
